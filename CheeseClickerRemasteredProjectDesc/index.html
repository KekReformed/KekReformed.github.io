                Cheese Clicker (pictured in the top right) was a small game that I created whilst still in college,
                in which the player would click on a picture of cheese in order to gain more cheese. The player could
                use this cheese as a currency to buy upgrades that would automatically make cheese for them.
                Cheese Clicker Remastered (pictured in the bottom right) is a complete remake of that original project,
                created as a way to learn
                React.js, it includes lots of new upgrades, a save feature and a complete graphical redesign from the
                original
